# Reverse An Array

## Challenge 
- Write a function that takes in an array and returns an (a new) array that is reversed.

## Approach
- We first started off by identifying and storing the first and last values of the array, then inside of our while loop we store the original value in a temporary variable (tmp). We then swap the values of the first and last items.
After that, we will increment the starting index and decriment the ending index in order to swap the entire array.
